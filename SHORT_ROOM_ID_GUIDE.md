# Short Room ID Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation provides a user-friendly short room code system (e.g., `0090B8`) instead of displaying full blockchain room IDs (e.g., `0x0090b8d800000000...`).

## Architecture

### Backend Implementation

#### 1. Room ID Utilities (`backend/utils/roomIdUtils.js`)

- **`encodeRoomId(fullRoomId)`**: Converts full bytes32 roomId to 6-character short code
- **`verifyRoomId(shortRoomId, fullRoomId)`**: Verifies if short code matches full ID
- **`findFullRoomId(shortRoomId, roomList)`**: Finds full roomId from short code in room list
- **`formatRoomIdDisplay(roomId)`**: Formats room ID for display (e.g., "Room #0090B8")
- **`isValidShortRoomId(shortRoomId)`**: Validates short room ID format (6 hex chars)

#### 2. Backend Server Updates (`backend/server.js`)

- Added `getRoomByShortId()` helper function to resolve short codes to full IDs
- Updated `createRoomWithBlockchain` to generate and store short room IDs
- Updated `joinRoomWithBlockchain` to log with short IDs
- Added API endpoints:
  - `GET /api/rooms/active` - Returns all rooms with short IDs
  - `GET /api/rooms/:roomId` - Accepts short or full room ID and returns room details

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Room ID Utilities (`frontend/src/utils/roomIdUtils.js`)

Same utilities as backend, plus:

- **`generateRoomUrl(roomId, baseUrl)`**: Generates shareable URL with short ID
- **`copyRoomCode(roomId)`**: Copies short code to clipboard

#### 2. RoomIdDisplay Component (`frontend/src/components/RoomIdDisplay.jsx`)

Three variants for displaying room codes:

**RoomIdDisplay** (default):

```jsx
<RoomIdDisplay roomId={blockchainRoomId} showCopy={true} showShare={false} />
```

- Displays short room code with copy button
- Optional share functionality

**RoomIdText**:

```jsx
<RoomIdText roomId={blockchainRoomId} />
```

- Simple inline text display (e.g., `#0090B8`)

**RoomIdHeader**:

```jsx
<RoomIdHeader roomId={blockchainRoomId} />
```

- Large display for room headers with gradient styling

#### 3. Modal Updates

**CreateRoomModal** (`frontend/src/components/CreateRoomModal.jsx`):

- Generates short room ID from blockchain room ID
- Passes `shortRoomId` to success callback
- Logs short code for easy sharing

**JoinRoomModal** (`frontend/src/components/JoinRoomModal.jsx`):

- Accepts both short codes (6 chars) and full IDs
- Auto-detects format and validates
- Resolves short codes via backend API
- Input field filters to hex characters only

#### 4. Page Updates

**Home** (`frontend/src/pages/Home.jsx`):

- Updated success callbacks to receive short room IDs
- Navigates using short IDs in URL (e.g., `/room/0090B8`)

**GameRoom** (`frontend/src/pages/GameRoom.jsx`):

- Resolves short room codes from URL to full blockchain IDs
- Uses `RoomIdDisplay` component in header and waiting screen
- Removed redundant copy button (now handled by component)

## User Flow

### Creating a Room

1. User creates room on blockchain → receives full bytes32 roomId
2. Backend extracts first 6 hex chars → generates short code (e.g., `0090B8`)
3. Short code displayed to user with easy copy/share
4. URL uses short code: `http://localhost:5173/room/0090B8`

### Joining a Room

1. User enters 6-digit code in join modal (e.g., `0090B8`)
2. Frontend validates format (6 hex characters)
3. Backend API resolves short code to full blockchain room ID
4. Frontend fetches room details from blockchain
5. User joins using full room ID for blockchain transaction

### Room Resolution

```
Short Code (0090B8)
    ↓
Backend API Lookup
    ↓
Full Room ID (0x0090b8d800000000...)
    ↓
Blockchain Transaction
```

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/rooms/active

Returns all active rooms with both full and short IDs.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "rooms": [
    {
      "roomId": "0x0090b8d800000000...",
      "shortRoomId": "0090B8",
      "creator": "0xAbc...",
      "playerCount": 2,
      "maxPlayers": 6,
      "buyIn": "1000",
      "state": "waiting",
      "blockchainRoomId": "0x0090b8d800000000..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### GET /api/rooms/:roomId

Accepts short code or full ID, returns room details.

**Request:**

```
GET /api/rooms/0090B8
or
GET /api/rooms/0x0090b8d800000000...
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "room": {
    "roomId": "0x0090b8d800000000...",
    "shortRoomId": "0090B8",
    "creator": "Player1",
    "playerCount": 2,
    "maxPlayers": 6,
    "buyIn": "1000",
    "state": "waiting",
    "blockchainRoomId": "0x0090b8d800000000..."
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: Easy to share and remember (6 characters vs 66)
2. **Flexible**: Accepts both short codes and full IDs
3. **URL-Friendly**: Clean URLs for sharing (`/room/0090B8`)
4. **Copy/Share**: Built-in clipboard and share functionality
5. **Backward Compatible**: Full blockchain IDs still work everywhere

## Testing

### Test Short Code Generation

```javascript
import { encodeRoomId } from "./utils/roomIdUtils";

const fullId =
  "0x0090b8d800000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000";
const shortId = encodeRoomId(fullId);
console.log(shortId); // "0090B8"
```

### Test Room Resolution

```bash
# Test with short code
curl http://localhost:3001/api/rooms/0090B8

# Test with full ID
curl http://localhost:3001/api/rooms/0x0090b8d800000000...
```

### Test Join Modal

1. Enter short code: `0090B8`
2. Click "Load Room Details"
3. Verify room details appear
4. Click "Join Room"
5. Verify blockchain transaction uses full ID

## Notes

- Short codes are **not unique globally** (only first 6 chars of full ID)
- Collision risk is low for typical game room counts
- Full blockchain ID is always used for transactions
- Short codes are purely for UI/UX convenience
- Backend maintains mapping between short and full IDs
