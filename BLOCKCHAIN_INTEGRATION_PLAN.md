# Teen Patti Blockchain Integration Plan

## Overview
Integrate smart contracts into the Teen Patti game to enable real token-based gameplay with blockchain transparency and security.

---

## 1. Token Economics

### Token System
- **Platform Token**: TeenPattiToken (TPT)
- **Conversion Rate**: 1 Wei = 100 TPT
- **Decimals**: 18 (standard ERC20)
- **Initial Supply**: Configurable (e.g., 1,000,000,000 TPT)

### Token Flow
```
User Wallet (ETH/MATIC) 
    ↓ (Buy Tokens)
Platform Contract (TPT)
    ↓ (Deposit to Game)
Game Contract (Escrow)
    ↓ (Win/Lose)
Winner Wallet (TPT) or Platform Contract (Rake)
```

---

## 2. Smart Contract Architecture

### Contract 1: TeenPattiToken (ERC20)
**Purpose**: Platform currency for gameplay

**Functions**:
- `buyTokens()` - Purchase TPT with native currency (ETH/MATIC)
- `sellTokens(uint256 amount)` - Sell TPT back for native currency
- `transfer()` - Standard ERC20 transfer
- `approve()` - Approve game contract to spend tokens
- `balanceOf()` - Check user token balance

**Features**:
- Mintable (only by owner for initial distribution)
- Burnable (for deflationary mechanism)
- Pausable (emergency stop)

---

### Contract 2: TeenPattiGame
**Purpose**: Manage game rooms, bets, and payouts

**Key Functions**:

#### Room Management
- `createRoom(uint256 buyIn, uint256 maxPlayers)` - Create game room with entry fee
- `joinRoom(bytes32 roomId)` - Join existing room (transfers buy-in to contract)
- `leaveRoom(bytes32 roomId)` - Leave room before game starts (refund)
- `closeRoom(bytes32 roomId)` - Close room after game ends

#### Game Flow
- `startGame(bytes32 roomId)` - Lock funds and start game
- `placeBet(bytes32 roomId, uint256 amount)` - Player places bet (deducted from buy-in)
- `declareWinner(bytes32 roomId, address winner)` - Distribute pot to winner
- `handleTimeout(bytes32 roomId)` - Handle game timeout/abandonment

#### Financial
- `depositToRoom(bytes32 roomId, uint256 amount)` - Add more chips to active game
- `withdrawWinnings(bytes32 roomId)` - Withdraw winnings after game
- `emergencyWithdraw(bytes32 roomId)` - Emergency withdrawal (with penalty)

**State Variables**:
```solidity
struct Room {
    bytes32 roomId;
    address[] players;
    uint256 buyIn;
    uint256 pot;
    uint256 maxPlayers;
    mapping(address => uint256) playerBalances;
    GameState state; // WAITING, ACTIVE, FINISHED
    address winner;
    uint256 createdAt;
    uint256 finishedAt;
}

mapping(bytes32 => Room) public rooms;
```

**Events**:
- `RoomCreated(bytes32 roomId, address creator, uint256 buyIn)`
- `PlayerJoined(bytes32 roomId, address player)`
- `GameStarted(bytes32 roomId, uint256 pot)`
- `BetPlaced(bytes32 roomId, address player, uint256 amount)`
- `WinnerDeclared(bytes32 roomId, address winner, uint256 amount)`
- `RoomClosed(bytes32 roomId)`

---

### Contract 3: TeenPattiRake (Optional)
**Purpose**: Platform fee collection and distribution

**Functions**:
- `collectRake(bytes32 roomId, uint256 amount)` - Collect platform fee (e.g., 2-5%)
- `withdrawRake()` - Owner withdraws collected fees
- `distributeRewards()` - Distribute rewards to token holders

---

## 3. Integration Points

### Frontend Integration

#### Wallet Connection
- **Library**: ethers.js or web3.js
- **Wallets**: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet
- **Networks**: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, or Testnet

**New Components**:
- `WalletConnect.jsx` - Connect/disconnect wallet
- `TokenBalance.jsx` - Display TPT balance
- `BuyTokens.jsx` - Purchase TPT tokens
- `TransactionStatus.jsx` - Show pending transactions

#### Modified Components
- **Home.jsx**: Add wallet connection + token balance display
- **GameRoom.jsx**: 
  - Show blockchain-backed chip balance
  - Display transaction confirmations
  - Handle blockchain transaction states

---

### Backend Integration

#### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
**Off-chain**: Game logic, card dealing, turn management (fast, no gas)
**On-chain**: Financial transactions, room creation, winner declaration (secure, transparent)

**Why Hybrid?**
- ✅ Fast gameplay (no waiting for blockchain confirmations)
- ✅ Secure finances (all money movements on-chain)
- ✅ Verifiable results (winner declaration on-chain)
- ✅ Lower gas costs (fewer transactions)

#### Backend Modifications
- Add blockchain service layer
- Store contract addresses and ABIs
- Monitor blockchain events
- Sign transactions for automated actions (using backend wallet)

**New Backend Files**:
- `blockchain/contracts/` - Contract ABIs
- `blockchain/service.js` - Blockchain interaction service
- `blockchain/events.js` - Event listeners
- `blockchain/wallet.js` - Backend wallet management

---

## 4. Game Flow with Blockchain

### Phase 1: Pre-Game (On-Chain)
1. User connects wallet
2. User buys TPT tokens (if needed)
3. User approves game contract to spend TPT
4. User creates/joins room → **Blockchain Transaction**
   - Buy-in amount locked in contract
   - Room created on-chain
5. Wait for other players

### Phase 2: Gameplay (Off-Chain)
1. Game starts (backend manages game state)
2. Cards dealt (off-chain, server-side)
3. Players bet/fold (tracked off-chain)
4. All game logic runs on WebSocket server
5. **No blockchain transactions during active play**

### Phase 3: Post-Game (On-Chain)
1. Game ends, winner determined (off-chain)
2. Backend calls `declareWinner()` → **Blockchain Transaction**
3. Smart contract:
   - Deducts rake (e.g., 5%)
   - Transfers pot to winner
   - Updates player balances
4. Winner can withdraw TPT to wallet
5. Room closed on-chain

---

## 5. Security Considerations

### Smart Contract Security
- ✅ Use OpenZeppelin contracts (audited)
- ✅ Implement reentrancy guards
- ✅ Add pausable functionality
- ✅ Time-locks for critical functions
- ✅ Multi-sig for owner functions
- ✅ Rate limiting on token purchases

### Game Integrity
- ✅ Backend signs winner declaration (prevents frontend manipulation)
- ✅ Store game hash on-chain for verification
- ✅ Implement dispute resolution mechanism
- ✅ Timeout handling for abandoned games

### Anti-Cheating
- ✅ Server-side card shuffling (not visible to clients)
- ✅ Commit-reveal scheme for card verification (optional)
- ✅ Backend validates all player actions
- ✅ Rate limiting on room creation

---

## 6. User Experience Enhancements

### Wallet Integration
- Auto-connect on return visit
- Show pending transaction notifications
- Display gas estimates before transactions
- Handle transaction failures gracefully

### Token Management
- Quick buy buttons (e.g., "Buy 1000 TPT", "Buy 5000 TPT")
- Display USD equivalent of TPT
- Show transaction history
- Enable auto-approval for game contract

### Game Experience
- Show "Transaction Pending" overlay during blockchain operations
- Display confirmation count for transactions
- Allow gameplay to continue while transactions confirm
- Cache balances to avoid constant blockchain queries
